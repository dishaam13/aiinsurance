**[Click Raj's card]**

**[Journey header appears with Raj's info]**

### **3:30 - 5:30 | WOW #2: Before vs After**

**[Click "Start Comparison"]**

**[Animated counters start: 2% → 8%, 15% → 43%, etc.]**

> "Watch the numbers: Generic marketing had 2% conversion, TrustAI gets 8% — that's 4x better. Open rate was 15%, now 43% — nearly 3x improvement. Customer satisfaction jumped from 28 to 87."

**[Point to side-by-side messages]**

> "Look at the message quality. Before: 'Dear Customer, we have insurance products.' Generic. Impersonal. After: 'Congratulations on your wedding, Priya! Family Health Insurance with 20% newlywed discount.' Relevant. Timely. Personal."

**[Click "Inject Bias Into System"]**

**[Screen turns red, alerts flash]**

> "Now I'm simulating what happens if bias creeps in..."

**[Dramatic red alert appears: "CRITICAL BIAS DETECTED"]**

> "BOOM. System instantly detected bias — male customers getting 12% conversion, females only 4%. That's a 3x disparity. What happens next is crucial..."

**[Show "47 campaigns automatically PAUSED"]**

> "All 47 pending campaigns immediately paused. No unfair campaigns can go out. The AI doesn't ask permission — it protects customers automatically."

**[Click "Fix Bias & Resume"]**

**[Green success screen appears]**

## 📊 If Judges Ask Questions

**Q: Is this real data?**  
A: It's a synthetic dataset designed to demo the concept, but the CSV upload works with any real customer data following our template.

**Q: How does segmentation work?**  
A: AI analyzes age, marital status, dependents, income — then classifies into 6 segments and recommends the most relevant insurance product.

**Q: What if bias is detected in production?**  
A: System auto-pauses all pending campaigns, alerts the team, requires human review before resuming. Zero tolerance policy.

**Q: Can this scale to millions of customers?**  
A: Yes — current architecture is designed for horizontal scaling. We process 4 customers in under 2 seconds, linearly scalable to millions.

**Q: What makes this different from existing tools?**  
A: Three things: (1) Real CSV integration, (2) Real-time bias prevention (not post-hoc reporting), (3) Full transparency with customer journey visualization.
